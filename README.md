# EnglishToHindiTranslator
A machine learning model to translate english to hindi.

This code is an implementation of a language translation model using an Encoder-Decoder architecture with an attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset of English and Hindi sentences. The code preprocesses the data by removing special characters, digits, and punctuation, and adds start and end tokens to the target sequences. The cleaned dataset is split into training and testing sets.

The model is built using Keras and consists of an LSTM-based Encoder and Decoder, with an attention mechanism to enable the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence during translation. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function. The model performance is evaluated on the test set, and the training is stopped early using the EarlyStopping callback to prevent overfitting.

The code also includes code to visualize the attention weights for each input sequence during the translation process. The model achieves a validation accuracy of over 80% on the test set.

This code can be used as a reference implementation for building language translation models using an Encoder-Decoder architecture with attention. The dataset used can be replaced with any other dataset in a similar format for training a translation model for other language pairs.
